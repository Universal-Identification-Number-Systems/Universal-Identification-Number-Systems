# Universal Identification Number Systems (UUIS)

## 1. System Goal

**UUIS** provides a globally unique and secure identification system for individuals, vehicles, institutions, and devices.
Purpose: Enable cross-sector integration with a single ID usable by governments, corporations, and international organizations.

## 2. Key Features

* Ultra-Secure UUIS: 256–512 bit, quantum-resistant, globally unique.
* Sector Modularization: Traffic, health, finance, education, IoT, and more.
* Blockchain-Backed Audit: Immutable records for certificates and critical transactions.
* Security: JWT/OAuth2 authentication, HTTPS, role-based access control (RBAC), end-to-end encryption.
* Mobile & Web Access: Dashboards for individuals and institutions, verification and management panels.

## 3. UUIS Example Structure

* Vehicle UUIS: `UUIS-KU-VEH-20250914-8f3a5c2b7d1e9f0a4c6d8e2f7b1c3d9e`
* Person UUIS: `UUIS-KU-PER-20250914-9d4f7e3b1c2a8f6b5e7d9a1c3f4b6e8d`
* Certificate UUIS: `UUIS-KU-CERT-20250914-abcdef1234567890`

## 4. API Overview

* Core Identity Endpoints: Create, verify, query UUIS.
* Sector Endpoints: `/traffic`, `/health`, `/finance`, `/education`, `/iot`
* Blockchain Verification: Immutable certificate verification.
* Security: JWT auth, RBAC, rate limiting, encryption.

Example:

```http
POST /api/v1/person
{
  "first_name": "Enes",
  "last_name": "Balikci",
  "birth_date": "2005-06-09",
  "birth_city": "Eleskirt",
  "country": "Kurdistan"
}
→ Returns: "uuis": "UUIS-KU-PER-20250914-9d4f7e3b1c2a8f6b5e7d9a1c3f4b6e8d"
```

## 5. Sector Use Cases

* Traffic: Vehicle, license plate, driver, penalty points, insurance.
* Health: Patient record, lab results, prescriptions.
* Finance: Banking, insurance, credit.
* Education: Diplomas, certificates verification.
* IoT / Smart City: Device and sensor identity, data verification.

## 6. Revenue Model

1. Platform License: Annual subscription for governments and institutions.
2. API Access: Subscription or per-use fee for health, finance, insurance, IoT providers.
3. Premium Verification Services: Certificates, diplomas, international validation.
4. Blockchain Service: Transaction-based fees.
5. Mobile/Web Application: Subscription for individual and enterprise users.

## 7. Summary

**UUIS** is a secure, global, cross-sector, future-proof identity system.
Every individual, vehicle, or device is identified with a single UUIS, and all data is managed on a centralized and secure infrastructure.
