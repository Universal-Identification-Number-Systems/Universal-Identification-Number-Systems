# Universal Identification Number Systems (UUIS) - Technical README

## 1. System Objective

**UUIS** is designed as a **cryptographically secure, globally unique identification framework** for individuals, vehicles, institutions, and IoT devices. The system ensures cross-sector interoperability, verifiable identity management, and tamper-proof auditability using blockchain technology and advanced cryptographic standards.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

* **Identity Module:** Generates and manages UUIS identifiers using 256–512 bit quantum-resistant algorithms (e.g., SHA-3 + elliptic curve hybrid).
* **Sector Modules:** Modular APIs for Traffic, Health, Finance, Education, IoT, and Government entities.
* **Blockchain Ledger:** Permissioned blockchain for immutable recording of critical events, certificates, and verification logs.
* **Access & Authentication:** JWT/OAuth2 with RBAC, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and end-to-end encryption.
* **Data Storage:** Hybrid storage with relational (PostgreSQL/SQLite) for structured data and decentralized IPFS-like storage for certificates and verifiable assets.

### 2.2 System Workflow

1. Entity registration via sector-specific API.
2. UUIS generation and issuance.
3. Secure storage in the database and optional blockchain anchor.
4. Verification requests validated against cryptographic proofs.
5. Audit trails automatically recorded and cryptographically signed.

### 2.3 Security & Privacy

* **Quantum-resistant cryptography:** Ensures long-term security against post-quantum attacks.
* **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained permissions for users, administrators, and auditors.
* **End-to-end Encryption:** TLS 1.3 for network, AES-256 for storage, and public-key cryptography for verification.
* **Anonymization & GDPR Compliance:** Personal data can be pseudonymized, and consent-based access logging is enforced.

## 3. UUIS Identifier Structure

### 3.1 Overview

The UUIS identifier is a **globally unique, cryptographically secure string** designed to uniquely represent any individual, vehicle, certificate, or device. It combines several metadata layers, cryptographic hashing, and optional blockchain anchoring to ensure immutability and auditability.

### 3.2 Components

1. **Prefix:** Defines the system type and geographic region (e.g., `UUIS-KU`).
2. **Entity Type:** Indicates the type of entity (`PER` for person, `VEH` for vehicle, `CERT` for certificate, `DEV` for IoT device).
3. **Date Stamp:** ISO 8601 date of issuance in `YYYYMMDD` format.
4. **Randomized Cryptographic Hash:** 256–512 bit hash generated using a combination of:

   * SHA-3 hashing of entity metadata
   * Elliptic curve cryptography for uniqueness
   * Optional sector-specific salt for collision avoidance
5. **Checksum / Verification Digit:** Optional modulo-based or hash-derived checksum for quick integrity verification.
6. **Blockchain Anchor (Optional):** Hash pointer linking the identifier to a blockchain transaction for verifiable audit trail.

### 3.3 UUIS Format Examples

* **Vehicle:** `UUIS-KU-VEH-20250914-8f3a5c2b7d1e9f0a4c6d8e2f7b1c3d9e`
* **Person:** `UUIS-KU-PER-20250914-9d4f7e3b1c2a8f6b5e7d9a1c3f4b6e8d`
* **Certificate:** `UUIS-KU-CERT-20250914-abcdef1234567890`
* **IoT Device:** `UUIS-KU-DEV-20250914-1234abcd5678ef9012345678abcd9ef0`

### 3.4 Technical Properties

* **Length:** Variable, typically 256–512 bits represented in hexadecimal or base58 encoding.
* **Uniqueness Guarantee:** Combination of date stamp, cryptographic hash, and optional blockchain anchoring ensures global uniqueness.
* **Collision Resistance:** Leveraging SHA-3 and ECC prevents identifier collisions even in high-throughput environments.
* **Verifiability:** Each identifier can be verified independently against cryptographic proofs and optionally cross-checked with blockchain records.
* **Scalability:** Designed to support billions of identifiers across multiple sectors without compromising performance.

### 3.5 Lifecycle

1. **Generation:** Upon entity registration via API.
2. **Issuance:** Stored in relational database and optionally anchored to blockchain.
3. **Validation:** Can be checked against cryptographic proofs for authenticity.
4. **Revocation / Expiration:** Support for temporary identifiers, certificate expiry, or revoked entities, logged in audit trail.
